				The <b>Right Outer Join</b> operator returns each row that satisfies the join of the second (bottom) input with each matching
				row from the first (top) input. It also returns any rows from the second input that had no matching rows in the first input,
				joined with <c>NULL</c>. If no join predicate exists in the <c>Predicate</c> property, each row is a matching row.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Right Outer Join</b> is a logical operator.
