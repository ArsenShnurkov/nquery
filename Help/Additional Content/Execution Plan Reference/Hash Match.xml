				The <b>Hash Match</b> operator builds a hash table by computing a hash value for each row from its build input. The
				<c>Hash Keys Build</c> property contains a list of columns used to create a hash value. Then, for each probe row
				(as applicable), it computes a hash value (using the same hash function) and looks in the hash table for matches. If
				a residual predicate is present (<c>Residual</c> property), that predicate must also be satisfied for rows to be
				considered a match. The first (top) input is used to build the hash table and the second (bottom) input to probe the
				hash table. Output matches (or nonmatches) as dictated by the join type.

				<b>Hash Match</b> is a physical operator.
