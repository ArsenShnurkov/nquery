				NQuery provides member completion and parameter info code assistance features. These features are directly built into the NQuery
				core assembly. So if you cannot use the provided <see cref="T:NQuery.UI.ActiproLink">Actipro Synatx Editor Integration</see> you
				can still use these features to integrate in your own syntax editor without starting from scratch. See
				<a href="..\Extensibility\CustomCodeAssistance.html">Custom Code Assistance</a> for details.

				Since this feature is context-aware the contents of member completion list depends on usage. For example, it can provide
				a list of all elements of the <a href="DataContext.html">DataContext</a>:
